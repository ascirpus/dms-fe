## Quick Reference

### Navigation

Once logged in, you'll find these sections in the app:

| Section | Path | What it does |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Projects | `/app/projects` | Your project list and document management |
| Search | `/app/search` | Full-text search across all your documents |

### Key Concepts

- **Workspace** - Your organization's isolated environment in CedarStack. Each workspace has its own projects, members, and settings.
- **Project** - A container for related documents. Projects have their own team (parties and members) and permission settings.
- **Party** - A named group within a project (e.g., "Legal", "Contractor", "Client"). Members are assigned to parties, and parties are granted document permissions.
- **Document Type** - A category for documents (e.g., Invoice, Contract, Quote). Document types control default permission levels and approval requirements.

### Roles

| Role | What they can do |
|------|-----------------|
| Member | View projects and documents they have access to |
| Admin | Manage projects, documents, users, parties, and workspace settings |
| Owner | Everything an Admin can do, plus billing and subscription management |
