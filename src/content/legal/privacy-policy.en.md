# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 9, 2026*

## Who we are

CedarStack is a document management service. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and how we handle it. If you have questions, contact us at [support@cedar-stack.com](mailto:support@cedar-stack.com).

## What we collect

### Account information

When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and profile picture. This information comes from your login provider (Keycloak) and is used to identify you within the service.

### Documents and content

We store the documents you upload, along with annotations, comments, and project metadata. This is the core of what we do — we need your content to provide the service.

If you use a self-hosted file store, your document files remain on your own infrastructure. However, we still collect and process document metadata — such as file names, page counts, and text content — to provide search, indexing, and annotation features.

### Workspace information

If you create or join a workspace, we store the workspace name, membership, and settings. Other members of your workspace can see your name and profile picture.

### Usage data

We use PostHog to collect anonymous usage data such as page views and feature interactions. This data is stored in memory only and is not persisted across sessions. We do not use cookies for analytics. This data helps us understand how the service is used so we can improve it.

### Authentication cookies

We use cookies strictly for authentication and session management. These are essential for the service to work and cannot be disabled.

## Why we collect it

We only collect data that's necessary to provide and improve the service:

- **To provide the service** — storing your documents, managing your account, enabling collaboration
- **To improve the service** — understanding which features are used and where users run into problems
- **To communicate with you** — sending notifications you've opted into, responding to support requests
- **To process payments** — if you have a paid subscription, we share necessary billing information with our payment processor

## Who we share it with

We don't sell your data. We don't use it for advertising. We share data only with:

- **Workspace members** — your name and profile picture are visible to people in your workspace
- **Service providers** — we use third-party services to operate (hosting, payment processing, analytics). These providers only receive the minimum data necessary and are bound by their own privacy policies
- **Legal requirements** — if required by law, we may disclose data to comply with legal obligations

## Where your data is stored

Your data is stored on servers in the European Union. Analytics data is processed by PostHog's EU infrastructure.

## How long we keep it

- **Account data** — kept as long as your account is active. Deleted when you delete your account.
- **Documents and content** — kept until you delete them, or until your account is deleted.
- **Usage data** — anonymous analytics data is retained for up to 12 months.
- **Payment records** — kept as long as required by tax and accounting regulations.

## Your rights

Under Swiss and European data protection law, you have the right to:

- **Access** your personal data
- **Correct** inaccurate data
- **Delete** your data
- **Export** your data in a portable format
- **Object** to processing of your data

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at [support@cedar-stack.com](mailto:support@cedar-stack.com).

## Children

CedarStack is not intended for anyone under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you via email or through the service.
