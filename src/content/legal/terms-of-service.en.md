# Terms of Service

*Last updated: February 9, 2026*

## What this document covers

These terms are an agreement between you and CedarStack. By creating an account or using the service, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use CedarStack.

## Your account

- You need an account to use CedarStack. Provide accurate information when signing up.
- You're responsible for keeping your login credentials secure. If you suspect unauthorized access, let us know immediately.
- You must be at least 16 years old to use the service.

## What you can do

CedarStack lets you upload, store, organize, and annotate documents within workspaces and projects. You can collaborate with others by inviting them to your workspace.

## What you can't do

You agree not to upload, share, or store:

- Pornographic, sexually explicit, or obscene material
- Content that promotes violence, hatred, or discrimination
- Malware, viruses, or any malicious code
- Content that infringes on someone else's intellectual property (copyrights, trademarks, etc.)
- Any material that violates applicable laws

You also agree not to:

- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other accounts or CedarStack systems
- Use the service to scrape, crawl, or overload our infrastructure
- Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the service
- Use CedarStack for any illegal purpose

## Your content

- You own the documents and content you upload. CedarStack does not claim ownership of your content.
- By uploading content, you grant us a limited license to host, store, display, and process it — solely to provide the service to you.
- You can delete your content at any time. Once deleted, we'll remove it from our systems within a reasonable timeframe.

## Payment and billing

- Some features require a paid subscription. Prices are displayed before you subscribe.
- Subscriptions renew automatically. You can cancel anytime, and you'll keep access until the end of your current billing period.
- We may change pricing with at least 30 days' notice. Existing billing periods won't be affected.
- Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. Contact us if you believe you've been charged in error.

## Service availability

- We aim to keep CedarStack running smoothly, but we can't guarantee 100% uptime.
- We may perform maintenance that temporarily makes the service unavailable. We'll try to give advance notice when possible.
- We're not responsible for data loss. That said, we take reasonable measures to back up and protect your data.

## Termination

- You can delete your account at any time.
- We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms, with notice when reasonably possible.
- If your account is terminated, you'll have a reasonable window to export your data, unless the termination is due to illegal activity.

## Limitation of liability

CedarStack is provided "as is." To the fullest extent permitted by law, we're not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the service. Our total liability is limited to the amount you've paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## Changes to these terms

We may update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you via email or through the service. Continued use after changes take effect means you accept the updated terms.

## Governing law

These terms are governed by the laws of Switzerland. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Switzerland.
